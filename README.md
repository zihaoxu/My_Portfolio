## On-going Projects 
### BikesSGV  
Last semester, I represented Tech for Good, a student organization that helps local non-profits with finding technical solutions to impactful problems, as the technical lead and worked with the Bike San Gabriel Valley to help them analyze bike count data they gathered over the past few years. I led a team of 4 and together, we cleaned, wrangled and visualized the datasets and our results are featured in BikeSGV's [end-of-year report](http://www.bikesgv.org/sgvcounts.html).  
This semester, we will continue helping BikeSGV with several in-depth data analyses. While working on the project, you will gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, wrangling, visualization and maybe machine learning.

## Past Experiences  

### Bayesian Neural Networks
This project is an exploration into the intersection of the Bayesian Paradigm and Deep Learning. We apply the Bayesian Neural Networks to two different tasks: a regression task using a toy dataset and a classification task using the Wine dataset obtained from UCI ML Repo.

### Bag of Little Random Forests (BLRF)  
Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) are an ensemble method that utilizes a number of deci- sion trees to make robust predictions in both regression and classification settings. However, the process of bootstrap aggregation, the mechanism underlying the Random Forests algo- rithm, requires each decision tree to physically store and perform computations on data sets of the same size as the training data set. This situation is oftentimes impractical given the large size of data sets nowadays. To address this problem, we introduce the Bag of Little Ran- dom Forests (BLRF), a new algorithm that combines the Random Forests with the Bag of Little Bootstraps (Kleiner et al., 2014) resampling method, aiming to achieve a better computational profile while producing predictions with comparable accuracy as those of the Random Forests. The project is submitted to the 2017 Fall Undergraduate Research Project Competition and won the first prize.

### Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis  
In this project, we explored and performed sentiment analysis on reviews obtained from the Yelp Data Challenge. We explored temporal trends of review sentiment as well as interesting interactions between review tags. We also build a sentiment predictor for reviews solely based on text analysis. The resulting interactive module allows us to assess the sentiment of a unlabeled piece of review text with a confidence score.

### KKBox Churning Prediction Kaggle Challenge  
In this project, we aim to document our methodologies in approaching the KKBox Churning Prediction Challenge. This challenge is essentially a classification problem, but the response variable is highly imbalanced. In the below sections, we will describe and visually explore the data sets. Then we will talk about several machine learning models we employed that are highly suitable for handling imbalanced data. Our current ranking on Kaggle is 136 out of 535, achieved by the XGBoost model.

### Yelp - Zillow Data Analytics - jac_project   
The purpose of the project was to explore and analyze the interaction between Zillow hosing price index and Yelp restaurant ratings to identify temporal trends. We merged and integrated the datasets by geospatial locations and performed various analyses. One of our most interesting findings was that, the most expensive restaurants, if located at a relative poor neighborhood, have experienced a significant decreasing trend in rating; however, the ratings remained constant for those located at a relatively rich neighborhood.

### Statsketball Challenge - ASA  
In this project, we aim to predict 2017 NCAA March Madness basketball game results using Support Vector Machine. We scraped data from two sources: Kenpom and Sport-references, cleaned and wrangled the data, and trained a SVM model to predict the actual game results, yielding a accuracy of 84.375% on out of sample data.

### Expedia Challenge - UCLA DataFest  
Using the dataset from Expedia, we segmented the market by families with varying number of children and explored the different behaviors of these segments. Using visualization techniques like heatmap and geomap, we were able to discover differences in travel planning habits, popular destinations of each group, as well as identifying the geographical distribution of large/small families to allow for better targeted promotion.
