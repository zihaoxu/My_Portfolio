## On-going Projects  
### Bag of Little Random Forests(BLRF)  
Random Forests are an ensemble method that utilizes a number of decision trees to make predictions robust in both regression and classification settings. However, the process of bootstrap aggregation, the mechanism underlying the random forest algorithm, requires each decision tree to physically store and perform computations on data sets of the same size as the input training set, a situation that is oftentimes impractical given the humongous sizes of data sets today. To address this problem, we introduce the Bag of Little Random Forests (BLRF), a new algorithm that adapts the Bags of Little Bootstraps to a Big Data setting, aiming to achieve a better computational profile while producing predictions with comparable accuracy as those of the standard random forest.

## Past Experiences  
### Yelp - Zillow Data Analytics - jac_project   
The purpose of the project was to explore and analyze the interaction between Zillow hosing price index and Yelp restaurant ratings to identify temporal trends. We merged and integrated the datasets by geospatial locations and performed various analyses. One of our most interesting findings was that, the most expensive restaurants, if located at a relative poor neighborhood, have experienced a significant decreasing trend in rating; however, the ratings remained constant for those located at a relatively rich neighborhood.

### Statsketball Challenge - ASA  
In this project, we aim to predict 2017 NCAA March Madness basketball game results using Support Vector Machine. We scraped data from two sources: Kenpom and Sport-references, cleaned and wrangled the data, and trained a SVM model to predict the actual game results, yielding a accuracy of 84.375% on out of sample data.

### Expedia Challenge - UCLA DataFest  
Using the dataset from Expedia, we segmented the market by families with varying number of children and explored the different behaviors of these segments. Using visualization techniques like heatmap and geomap, we were able to discover differences in travel planning habits, popular destinations of each group, as well as identifying the geographical distribution of large/small families to allow for better targeted promotion.
